## ðŸ›  Project Structure

The application consists of three main files:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `index.html` | The main structure of the SPA. Defines all screens (`auth`, `dashboard`, `questionnaire`, `results`, `history`, `basics`) and includes Tailwind CSS and the main script. |
| `app.js` | The core JavaScript file managing the application logic. Handles state, screen transitions, user authentication, quiz functionality, Dosha calculation, history management, and the basics carousel. |
| `style.css` | Custom CSS rules, primarily for unique elements like the splash screen animation, the processing spinner, custom radio buttons, and the new basics carousel scroll behavior. |

### Assets (Required Images)

The following image files are expected to be present in the same directory as the HTML/CSS/JS files for the application to display correctly:

| Category | File Names | Purpose |
